/**
 * Post-commit hook that creates log compaction files (`<x>.<y>.compacted.json`) to speed up
 * snapshot construction without the cost of a full checkpoint.
 *
 * When enabled (`deltaLog.logCompaction.enabled`), after a commit whose version is a multiple of
 * the configured interval (`deltaLog.logCompaction.interval`), this hook reconciles the most recent
 * window of commits into a single compaction file. The window is `[startVersion, committedVersion]`
 * where `startVersion = max(committedVersion - interval + 1, lastCheckpointVersion + 1)`. Bounding
 * the window below by the last checkpoint avoids producing a compaction that spans (and is thus
 * subsumed by) a checkpoint.
 *
 * Reconciling a fixed window keeps the produced compaction files non-overlapping so that, when the
 * checkpoint interval is a multiple of the compaction interval, they tile the commit range and can
 * be chained by the reader (see `useCompactedDeltasForLogSegment`). Producing an ever-growing range
 * would instead yield overlapping files where the reader only ever uses the smallest one.
 *
 * If a checkpoint was just written for this commit, the hook does nothing, because a checkpoint
 * already subsumes the commits a compaction would cover.
 *
 * Log compaction files are optional and do not require any protocol or table-feature upgrade.
 * Readers that support compacted deltas (`deltaLog.minorCompaction.useForReads`) use them to speed
 * up snapshot construction; readers that don't simply ignore them.
